A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.







IMPORTANT THING BEFORE USING THIS


⚠️ API Quota Limitation (News Data)
This application uses the Developer (Free) tier of the News API, which imposes a strict usage limit.

If the app fails to load news articles and displays an "Error loading data: code: rateLimited" message, it means the application has exceeded the allowed quota:

Limit: The application is restricted to 100 requests every 24 hours (and 50 requests every 12 hours).

Resolution: If this error occurs, access will be blocked until the time window passes and the quota resets (usually 12 hours from the last exceeded request). Please wait and try again later. For continuous, high-volume use, an upgrade to a paid API plan is required.


EXAMPLE ::: Think of it like a battery: once the battery (your quota) is empty, you have to plug it in and wait (the time period) before you can use the app again.
